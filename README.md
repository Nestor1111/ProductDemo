# ProductDemo

## Description
Spring Boot REST API endpoint that returns products.

## Usage
- Run server after compile

        cd target
        
        java -jar ProductDemo-1.jar
		
		Go to http://localhost:8080/products
		
## Notes
I did not have time to finish some details:
- There is only one simple test. I would add many different test cases with the possibilities offered by JUnit.
- There is not exception handling.
- I would add Swagger documentation.
