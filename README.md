# ProductDemo

## Description

## Usage
- Run server after compile

        cd target
        
        java -jar ProductDemo-1.jar
		
		Go to http://localhost:8080/products
		
## Notes
I did not finish:
- There is not exception handling.
- There is only one simple JUnit test.
- I would add Swagger documentation.
